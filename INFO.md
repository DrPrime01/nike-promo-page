## About Nike Promo Page
Nike Promo Page is a web application showcasing the product page of an e-Commerce website, Nike. It is built with ReactJS and vanilla CSS.
The Figma design was gotten from the Community Page of Figma, where free designs are available for development by freelancing software developers.

## The Production Stage
I developed the Nike Promo Page application in less than 24 hours. Although, there was no form of time documentation, I completed it in less than a day.
